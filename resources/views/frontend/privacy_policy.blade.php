    <h4>A Privacy Policy is a document where you disclose what personal data you collect from your website's visitors, how you collect it, how you use it and other important details about your privacy practices.</h4><br>

       <p> In this post, we'll take a look at what Privacy Policies are and why you likely need to have one posted on your website. We'll also go over some important clauses that are useful to include in your Privacy Policy. Finally, we'll look at how different websites display their Privacy Policies.

        Privacy Policies are legally binding agreements you are required to post on your website if you're collecting any sort of personal information from your site's visitors or customers.

        A Privacy Policy is an important legal document that lets users understand the various ways a website might be collecting personal information. The purpose of a Privacy Policy is to inform users of your data collection practices in order to protect the customer's privacy.

        Your Privacy Policy should disclose how the website/app collects information, how the information is used, whether or not it is shared with third parties and how it is protected and stored.

        There are 3 main reasons for having a Privacy Policy: (1) you're required by law, (2) you're required by third party services, (3) you want to be transparent.</p>
